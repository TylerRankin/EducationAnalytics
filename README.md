# EducationAnalytics
The goal of this project is to first web-scrape job posting websites for most commonly sought after 
skills by employers in the field of data science. Next, Online School course websites were scrapped for
top courses in the field of Data Science using these same key terms. Next, a recommender was created using your 
ideal job (from a list of scraped postings) as an input, and top ranked online courses that the individual 
should take to gain the skills to get that job as an output. 

To run the reccomender on its own, download the file "ZipRecruiter.csv" and have it in the same directory as the "Recc" notebook.
